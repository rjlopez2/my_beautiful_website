# Load libraries

let's setup renv to lock the project dependencies.

```{r}
#| output: false
install.packages("renv")
renv::init()
renv::snapshot()
```


in this section we call all libraries that we will require to run our analysis.

```{r}
#| output: false
library(babynames)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(pheatmap)
```

# Explore the dataset

## Check the first 10 babynames of the dataset

```{r}
head(babynames, 10) |> kable()
```

Here, We’ve created two functions that do the following:

-   `get_most_frequent`: Gets the most frequent babynames over a time-period.

-   `plot_top`: from the output of `get_most_frequent`. Plot the top n most popular names.

Let's now use these functions to visualize the plots.


```{r}
#| code-fold: true
get_most_frequent <- function(babynames, select_sex, from = 1950) {
  most_freq <- babynames |>
    filter(sex == select_sex, year > from) |>
    group_by(name) |>
    summarise(average = mean(prop)) |>
    arrange(desc(average))
    
  return(list(
    babynames = babynames,
    most_frequent = most_freq,
    sex = select_sex,
    from = from))
}

plot_top <- function(x, top = 10) {
  topx <- x$most_frequent$name[1:top]
  
  p <- x$babynames |>
    filter(name %in% topx, sex == x$sex, year > x$from) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = year, y = prop, color = name)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
    theme_classic()
  
  return(p)
}
```

## Plotting the 10 most frequently names for baby boys 👯‍♂️

```{r}
#| label: fig-freq-boys
#| fig-cap: "Most frequent names for baby boys"
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "M") |>
  plot_top()
```

From the @fig-freq-boys we observe a clear popularity of the name Michael and later other names such as Christopher and Mathew gained more popularity.

## Plotting the 10 most frequently names for baby girls 🤸‍♀️

```{r}
#| label: fig-freq-girl
#| fig-cap: "Most frequent names for baby girls"
get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "F") |>
  plot_top()
```
From the @fig-freq-girl we see that 



# Creating the missign figure

```{r}
# get most frequent girl names from 2010 onwards
from_year <- 2010
most_freq_girls <- get_most_frequent(babynames, select_sex = "F",
                                     from = from_year)

# plot top 5 girl names
most_freq_girls |>
  plot_top(top = 5)

# plot top 10 girl names
most_freq_girls |>
  plot_top(top = 10)

# get top 30 girl names in a matrix
# with names in rows and years in columns
prop_df <- babynames |> 
  filter(name %in% most_freq_girls$most_frequent$name[1:30] & sex == "F") |>
  filter(year >= from_year) |> 
  select(year, name, prop) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,
              values_from = prop)

prop_mat <- as.matrix(prop_df[, 2:ncol(prop_df)])
rownames(prop_mat) <- prop_df$name

# create heatmap
pheatmap(prop_mat, cluster_cols = FALSE, scale = "row")
```
